    summary: Use Spe in place of Atk
    notes: |
      * [HS] I feel like this would be more broken than it's turning out to be
      * [HS] Swapping Spe <---> Atk wasn't really doing anything. Changed to only use Spe for damage dealt, will create another card that uses Atk to decide combat order (E093)
