    summary: Stop casting copies of a creature
    notes: |
      * [HS] Seemed more useful when there were 4 copies of the same card. Now seems very situational, only useful against ally traits and weather setting traits. Maybe could be replaced by disabling the traits of a creature?
      * [HS] Buffed to disable creatures that share a trait (instead of name)
